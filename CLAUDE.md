## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Tools Class** (`google_workspace_tools.py:28-750`): Main integration class containing all Google Workspace functionality
- **Valves Class** (`google_workspace_tools.py:38-89`): Configuration settings for authentication and feature toggles
- **Authentication System** (`google_workspace_tools.py:142-278`): OAuth2 flow with token management and refresh
- **Gmail Functions** (`google_workspace_tools.py:280-506`): Email reading, searching, and draft creation
- **Public API Functions** (`google_workspace_tools.py:673-750`): Wrapper functions for LLM integration

### Key Features

1. **Authentication**: Two-step OAuth2 setup with credential management
2. **Gmail Integration**: Read emails, search, create drafts with threading support
3. **Attachment Management**: Download and extract email attachments with size limits
4. **Extensible Design**: Prepared for Calendar, Drive, and Tasks integration
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
6. **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure storage

### Data Storage

- Configuration and tokens stored in `/app/backend/data/google_tools/`
- Credentials saved as `credentials.json`
- OAuth tokens saved as `token.json`
- **Email attachments** saved in `/app/backend/data/google_tools/attachments/[email_id]/`

## Development

### Dependencies

This is a Python tool requiring Google API client libraries:
- `google-auth`
- `google-auth-oauthlib` 
- `google-auth-httplib2`
- `google-api-python-client`

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite available in `tests/` directory:
- **Interactive test runner**: `python tests/test_runner.py`
- **Gmail function tests**: `python tests/test_gmail.py`
- **Calendar function tests**: `python tests/test_calendar.py`
- **Contacts tests**: `python tests/test_contacts.py` (Phase 1)
- **Framework**: Credential loading, authentication validation
- **Coverage**: All Gmail and Calendar functions verified working

Built-in diagnostics:
- Authentication status checking
- Debug logging when `debug_mode` is enabled
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### Configuration

All configuration is handled through the `Valves` class including:
- Google OAuth2 credentials
- Enabled services (gmail, calendar, drive, tasks)
- Email fetch limits and content truncation
- **Attachment settings** (size limits, storage directory)
- Debug settings

## Gmail Attachment System

### Core Attachment Functions
- **`list_email_attachments(email_id)`**: Show detailed metadata for all attachments in an email
  - Returns filename, size, MIME type, and attachment IDs
  - Includes usage hints for downloading specific attachments
- **`download_email_attachment(email_id, attachment_id, filename=None)`**: Download specific attachment
  - Supports both attachment IDs and attachment indexes
  - Optional custom filename for saving
  - Size limit enforcement with clear error messages
- **`extract_all_attachments(email_id)`**: Download all attachments from an email
  - Batch processing with detailed success/failure reporting
  - Automatic skipping of oversized files
  - Total size and individual file reporting

### Enhanced Email Functions (Attachment Integration)
- **`get_recent_emails()`**: Now shows attachment indicators like "ðŸ“Ž 3 files (2.5MB)"
  - Optional `show_attachments=True` parameter for performance control
  - Smart detection only when needed
- **`search_emails()`**: Same attachment indicators plus search guidance
  - Includes tip about using `has:attachment` search query
  - Performance optimized attachment detection
- **`get_email_content()`**: Always shows attachment summary section
  - Lists all attachments with sizes and types
  - Provides direct action hints for downloading

### Attachment Processing
- **Dual API Support**: Handles both inline attachments and large separate attachments
- **Smart Detection**: Uses Content-Disposition headers and filename analysis
- **Size Management**: Configurable limits (default 10MB) with clear warnings
- **Security**: Filename sanitization and organized storage structure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when attachment detection fails

### Storage Organization
```
/app/backend/data/google_tools/attachments/
â”œâ”€â”€ [email_id_1]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ document.pdf
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ [email_id_2]/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spreadsheet.xlsx
```

### Configuration Settings
- `max_attachment_size_mb`: Maximum file size limit (default: 10MB)
- `attachment_storage_dir`: Storage directory name (default: "attachments")

### Performance Features
- **Conditional Processing**: Attachment detection only when `show_attachments=True`
- **Format Optimization**: Uses `metadata` format when attachments not needed
- **Caching**: Single-request attachment detection during processing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Email listings work even if attachment detection fails

## Open-WebUI Integration

This tool is designed as an Open-WebUI plugin where:
- The `Tools` class provides the main functionality
- Public functions at the bottom serve as the LLM-callable interface
- The `Valves` system handles user configuration through the Open-WebUI interface

## Development Strategy

### Branching Approach
- **`main` branch**: Stable, working code only
- **Feature branches**: `feature/[service]-integration` for each phase
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before merging to main
- **Commits**: Each phase committed separately with full functionality

### Phase-by-Phase Development
1. **Complete implementation** of all functions for a service
2. **Comprehensive testing** with dedicated test files
3. **Documentation updates** reflecting new functionality
4. **User validation** and feedback incorporation
5. **Commit to main** only when phase is fully working
6. **Assessment and planning** for next phase

### Current Status
- **Active branch**: `main` 
- **Status**: **Complete 5-service integration ready for production use**
- **Recent completion**: Google Drive integration with full functionality (Phase 3)
- **Production testing**: All 10 Drive functions verified working
- **Next focus**: Planning advanced features (Phase 4)
